//Creates a new experiment called "Probe Situation Report" that provides a small amount of science, can be
//performed anywhere, but is only biome specific when landed/splashed.  This experiment is designed to be
//added to probe cores and mimic basic telemetry data.  Basically giving a science value to the data you're
//ostensibly already using to pilot the probe.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = The probe sends back basic telemetry and operational data.
		default = All systems are performing nominally.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The probe is still sitting on the launchpad...
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The probe is still sitting on the runway...
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = We seem to have lost the probe on the grounds somewhere...
		KerbinFlyingLow = Please don't crash this very expensive and fragile Kerbal engineering marvel.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = I wonder if any of the instruments will still work if they get wet?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The probe is on its way into space...  Or crashing violenty back down to Kerbin.  Hopefully not that one.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The probe has made it safely into LKO, how boring.
		KerbinInSpace = Yep, the probe's still in space.

		MunInSpaceHigh = The probe has successfully entered the Mun's gravitational influence.
		MunInSpaceLow = Landing this thing is going to be interesting...
		MunSrfLanded = Several of the probe's primary sensors have been rendered inoperable by dust.  Shift to back up systems.  We do have back up systems right?

		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The probe has successfully entered the minimal gravitational influence of Minmus.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = This should be a lot easier than landing on the Mun.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The probe has landed succesfully on the surface of Minmus.  Whether or not it's intact may be another story...

		SunInSpace = The probe is on it's way to another planet, how exciting!
		SunInSpaceLow = Don't crash the probe into the sun!  You're going to crash it into the sun aren't you?  Think of its poor burning robot brains!

//Creates a new experiment called "Low Gravity Environment Experiments" which gives science comparable to a
//gravity/seismic scan, can only be performed in space low/high, and is never biome specific.  The experiment
//is designed to be added to the Mobile Processing Lab.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = The crew floats around the lab, observing the results of this most interesting, yet unnamed experiment.
		default = The crew is floating around aimlessly, enjoying the wonder of space.  This is most definitely not what we are paying them for...
		default = The crew jazzercises to help combat the effects of long-duration space missions.

		KerbinInSpaceLow = The crew takes time to stop and smell the roses, observing their smell has changed significantly after being grown in the low gravity environment.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The crew observes a common foodborne virus, finding that it becomes significantly more virulent in low gravity.
		KerbinInSpace = The crew engages in various experiments involving small, furry creatures.

		MunInSpaceLow = We've been lied to, according to sensors there's nothing here but dust and rocks.  I was promised cheese!

		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The crew studies the deliciousness of various minty frozen desserts...

		SunInSpace = The crew is in awe at our insignificance as Kerbin shrinks away to just another speck of dust floating through space... 
		SunInSpaceLow = Is it hot in here?  It seems really hot in here.  Maybe we're too close to the giant ball of flaming gas?
