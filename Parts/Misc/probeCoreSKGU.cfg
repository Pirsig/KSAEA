description = The Simulated Kerbal Guidance Unit is KSAEA's first attempt at automated guidance technology, it did not go so well.  It is highly in-effecient and has no independant means of control, but that won't stop us from selling it to you for top dollar.  The SKGU is at least capable of relaying data and receiving basic commands, keeping your kerbals safe from a possibly explosive mishap.
